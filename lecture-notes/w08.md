# AVL Trees

An AVL tree is a binary search tree with a balance condition. AVL is named
after its inventors <i><b>A</b>del'son-<b>V</b>el'skii and <b>L</b>andis</i>.
An AVL tree *approximates* the ideal tree, which is a completely balanced tree,
and maintains a height close to the minimum.

<blockquote title="Definition">
    An AVL tree is a binary search tree such that for any node in the tree, the
    height of the left and right subtrees can differ by at most 1.
