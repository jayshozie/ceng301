# Some Definitions

## Data Structure

A data structure is a particular way of organizing and storing data in a
computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. Different data
structures are suited to different kinds of applications, and some are highly
specialized to specific tasks. Common data structures include arrays, linked
lists, stacks, queues, trees, hash tables, and graphs.

## Abstract Data Type (ADT)

An abstract data type (ADT) is a mathematical model for a certain class of data
structures that have similar behavior. It is a specification of:
- **The Data:** The collection of data elements.
- **The Operations:** The set of functions that can be performed on that data
(e.g., `insert`, `remove`, `search`).

- **The Core of the Concept:**
    > **An ADT defines *what* a collectionof data does, not *how* it does it.**
    - It is an **interface** that specifies behavior without revealing the
    underlying implementation details.
    - **Example:** A **List** is an **ADT**. You know you can add or remove
    elements.
    - **Constrast:** A **Linked List** or an **Array** are the concrete **Data
    Structures** used to *implement* the List ADT.

So, even if we don't know exactly how an ADT is implemented, we just need to
understand the idea of the collection and what operations it can perform. We
use data structures to provide a concrete, physical implementation of an ADT.

# List ADT

- A **List** is a collection storing an ordered sequence of elements.
    - Each element is accessible by a 0-based index.
    - A list has a size, number of elements that have been added.
    - Elements can be added to the front, back, or to a specific index.
