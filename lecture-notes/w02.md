# C++ Overview

## C++ Techniques

Relevant techniques include:
1. C++ classes, with *private* and *public* members.
2. Function and operator name *overloading* to give "natural" function calls.
3. *Templates* to allow the same code to be used on a variate of different data types.
4. A clean *built-in I/O interface*, which itself involves overloading the input and output operators.
Learning these techniques is much of what C++ is about.[^1]

### Notes

Not exactly. I believe this statement is incomplete, because C++ is not
just about classes or overloading. It's more about system programming,
performance, and zero-overhead abstraction. By zero-overhead abstraction we
mean, you can use high-level, elegant features (like classes and templates)
**without sacrificing performance or control** of low-level languages like C.
C++ is a multi-paradigm language, meaning that it's not just an Object-Oriented
language. It fully supports at least four major programming paradigms:
- Procedural Programming (just like C, and the way you've learned to write up
until this point)
- Object-Orient Programming (the way you're learning right now, using classes
and inheritance)
- Generic Programming (using templates and the Standard Template Library, STL)
- Functional Programming (with features like lambda, which you should learn how
to use)

C++ allows us to implement complex algorithms and data structures in a way that
is closest to the machine, letting us analyze their true time and space
complexity without language overhead. Features like pointers give us precise
control over memory allocation, which is incredibly important to building
efficient data structures like graphs and hash tables from scratch. So, saying
that C++ is just about classes or overloading absurdly underestimates the power
of C++. Thank you for listening my TED Talk.
