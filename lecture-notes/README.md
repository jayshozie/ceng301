# Weekly Lecture Notes Written by Me

Here you can find all my lecture notes. Some of them may go outside the
scope of the course to help you understand a difficult subject better, but I
usually try to explain stuff within the scope, and if I believe you should
definitely know something that is outside the scope, then I explicitly write
that in the notes.
