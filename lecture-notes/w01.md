# Introduction to C++

C++ is a popular, high-level, cross-platform, object-oriented, general purpose
programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1985. First it was
released as an extension of the C programming language, adding OOP features;
as of 1997/C++98 standardization, C++ has added functional features, in
addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation.

## [Philosophy of C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B#Philosophy)

Throughout C++'s life, its development and evolution has been guided by a set
of principles:

- It must be driven by actual problems and its features should be immediately
useful in real world programs.
- Every feature should be implementable (with a reasonably obvious way to do
so).
- Programmers should be free to pick their own programming style, and that
style should be fully supported by C++.
- Allowing a useful feature is more important than preventing every possible
misuse of C++.
- It should provide facilities for organizing programs into separate,
well-defined parts, and provide facilities for combining separately developed
parts.
- No implicit violations of the type system (but allow explicit violations;
that is, those explicitly requested by the programmer).
- User-created types need to have the same support and performance as built-in
types.
- Unused features should not negatively impact created executables (e.g. in
lower performance).
- There should be no language beneath C++ (except assembly language).
- C++ should work alongside other existing programming languages, rather than
fostering its own separate and incompatible programming environment.
- If the programmer's intent is unknown, allow the programmer to specify it by
providing manual control.

This should be enough for now.

# A Basic C++ Program

## Example 1

In this program, we will ask the user for a real number, find the square root
of it, and print it in the console.

```cpp
// below are some libraries that we've opted to use in this example.
#include <iostream> // allows you to use std::cout and std::cin in this e.g.
#include <math.h> // allows you to use the `sqrt()` function.
// this is how you include them in your code.

using namespace std;
// i probably won't use namespaces unless explicitly asked by the instructor.

// this is your main function. your entire code, except possibly your
// functions, will be in the main function. the int type at the beginning of it
// tells you that this function will return an integer at the end.
int main()
{
    // float is another data type that holds floating point numbers.
    // you should remember them from your CENG240 or other prerequiset courses.
    float x;

    // we're "printing" (console out) that string to the console, and adding a
    // new line after that string.
    cout << "Enter a real number: " << endl;
    // we're awaiting input from the user.
    cin >> x;

    // we're doing the calculation and printing our result in the same line.
    cout << "The square root of " << x << " is: " << sqrt(x) << endl;

    // in most compilers, your main function doesn't need a return value. if it
    // doesn't crash, or doesn't throw a compiler error, it will return 0.
}
```

## Example 2

In this, actually easier, example, we will ask the user to provide us with 2
integers, we will add them up, and print our result.

```cpp
#inclued <iostream>

// the reason i won't use `using` is, first of all it makes the code harder to
// read, because there are way more libraries than the Standard Library.
// secondly, you may confuse them for functions/classes that you've written.
using std::cout;
using std::cin;
using std::endl;

int main()
{
    // we're initializing and assigning 2 integers for the sake of the
    // argument. you don't need to assign them numbers at this stage.
    int a=23;
    int b=34;

    cout << "Enter two integers:" << endl;
    // we're taking 2 inputs, and storing them in their respective variables.
    cin >> a >> b;
    cout << endl;

    cout << "a + b = " << a+b << endl;
    return 0;
    // you can explicitly tell the compiler to return 0 if it reaches this
    // line. it's not necessary, but it makes the code more readable.
}
```

# Data Types in C++

Firstly, C++ is a strongly-type programming language, which means every
variable has a type, name, value, and location in memory. The type of a
variable defines the contents of the varibale. Every type is either:
- primitive, or
- user-defined.

## Some Primitive Data Types

- **int (integer):** a whole number (positive or negative)
- **char (character):** a single character/single byte[^1]

### Notes

[^1]: Although C++23 now supports all Unicode characters for `char`, it didn't.
Which means, you should only use it to hold ASCII characters in the course,
because they're probably using C++98 or some similar standard in the labs.
Fun Fact: Even if we accept that C++23 supports Unicode characters, it wouldn't
be able to hold every Unicode character in a single byte, meaning it takes more
space to hold the character `ç`, than `i`.
