# Header Files

These are my versions of the header files constructed in the course.

# TODO

In [ArrayList.h](./ArrayList.h), [LinkedList.h](./LinkedList.h), and [Complex.h](./Complex.h)
- [ ] All thrown errors are `out_of_range` errors, change them to their correct
error type. For reference: [cppreference.com](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header/stdexcept.html)
- [ ] Turn all of them into templates that accept all types of variables.
